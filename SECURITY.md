## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Cinema Management System, please follow these steps:

### 🚨 **DO NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at security@yourcinema.com (replace with actual email)
2. **Provide detailed information** including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix and Disclosure**: Varies based on complexity

## Security Measures Implemented

### 🔐 **Application Security**

#### Input Validation
- ✅ Joi schema validation for all API inputs
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- ✅ XSS protection with input sanitization
- ✅ Request size limits

#### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Security headers with Helmet.js
- 🔄 JWT authentication (planned for v1.1)

#### Data Protection
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Database connection security
- ✅ Error message sanitization
- ✅ Audit logging

### 🗄️ **Database Security**

#### Access Control
- ✅ Dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- ✅ Connection pooling with limits
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Data validation at database level

#### Data Integrity
- ✅ Transaction support for critical operations
- ✅ Backup and recovery procedures
- ✅ Audit trail for sensitive operations

### 🐳 **Infrastructure Security**

#### Container Security
- ✅ Non-root user in Docker containers
- ✅ Minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- ✅ Health checks and monitoring
- ✅ Separate networks for services

#### Network Security
- ✅ Internal Docker networking
- ✅ Port exposure configuration
- ✅ Service isolation

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Use strong passwords
   DB_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
   JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
   
   # Restrict CORS origins
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourcinema.com
   
   # Enable security features
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Database Security**
   ```bash
   # Change default credentials
   POSTGRES_USER=cinema_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-password>
   
   # Use SSL in production
   POSTGRES_SSL=true
   ```

3. **Reverse Proxy**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper security headers
   - Enable request rate limiting
   - Set up fail2ban for brute force protection

### For Development

1. **Never commit sensitive data**
   - Use `.env` files (ignored by git)
   - Rotate development credentials regularly
   - Use different credentials for each environment

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Regular security scans**
   ```bash
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   npm audit
   
   # Update dependencies
   npm update
   ```

## 🚨 **Known Security Considerations**

### Current Limitations
- ❌ **No user authentication** - Currently no login system
- ❌ **No role-based access control** - All API endpoints are public
- ❌ **No input rate limiting per user** - Only IP-based limiting
- ❌ **No encryption at rest** - Database data is not encrypted

### Planned Security Enhancements (v1.1+)
- 🔄 JWT-based authentication system
- 🔄 Role-based access control (Admin, Employee, Customer)
- 🔄 API key management for external integrations
- 🔄 Database encryption at rest
- 🔄 Enhanced audit logging
- 🔄 GDPR compliance features

## 📋 **Security Checklist for Production**

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Configure environment variables properly
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins
- [ ] Configure rate limiting appropriately
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup procedures

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review audit logs weekly
- [ ] Rotate credentials quarterly
- [ ] Security vulnerability scans
- [ ] Penetration testing (annually)
